I2C MAX7313-based IO Expander cTc Wiring Harness

Manual panelization of the 2.1 design, made such that the unbroken board set would exactly fit the 2" spacing on the cTc machine panel.


Simple PCBs to help with taming the wiring ratsnest found behind a CTC machine's panels by concentrating the majority of LEDs and Switches directly on a PCB.


The [I2C-8574-cTc](/pages/I2C-8574-cTc.html) versions are simple wiring-to-I2C adapters, these 2.1 versions are mounting plates for switches and LEDs as well.
